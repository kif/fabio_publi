\section{Introduction}

One obstacle when writing software to analyse data collected from a
two-dimensional detector is to read the raw data into the program,
not least because the data can be stored in many different formats
depending on the instrument used.
To overcome this problem we decided to develop a general module,
FabIO (FABle I/O), to handle reading and writing of two-dimensional
data.
The codebase was initiated by merging parts of our fabian imageviewer
\cite{fabian} and ImageD11 \cite{ImageD11} peaksearch programs and has
been developed since 2007 as part of the FABLE \cite{fable} program suite
for analysis of 3DXRD microscopy data \cite{3dxrd}.
While getting integrated in many scientific programs like FitAllB
\cite{fitallb}, the FABLE graphical interface \cite{fable}, EDNA \cite{edna} and
the fast azimuthal integration library, pyFAI \cite{pyfai}; FabIO got
completed with missing features like multi-frame image formats as well as
writing many of the file formats.

We believe FabIO is now ready for a wider audience and could save other
researchers from repeating the work involved in decoding a
binary file format.The table \ref{format} shows the list of file formats that
FabIO can currently (ver. 0.1.0) read.


\section{FabIO Python module}

Python \cite{python} is a scripting language very popular among scientists but
it allows writting well structured application and libraries. FabIO is is
written in an object-oriented style (with classes) and has a comprehensive test suite
used to prevent regression during the development.

\subsection{Philosophy}

The intention behind this development was to create a python module which would enable easy reading
of 2D data images, from any detector, without having to worry about
the file format.
Therefore FabIO just needs a file name to open a file and it determines the
file format automatically and deals with gzip \cite{gzip} and bzip2
\cite{bzip2} compression transparently.
An object is returned which stores the image data in memory as a 2D
numpy array \cite{numpy}.
If the file contains header information (metadata), these are also read and stored
as strings in a python dictionary.

Methods are provided for reading the previous or next image in
a series of images as well as jumping to a specific file number.
For the user, these auxiliary methods are intended to be independent of
the image format (as far as is reasonably possible).
The software is very modular, this allow to includes new classes for handling 
other data formats quite easily. 
FabIO and its source-code are freely available to everyone on-line \cite{fabio}, 
licensed as GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). 

\subsection{Implementation}

Generally FabIO have been code in Python\cite{python},
though for some image formats the python code is merely interfaced a reading
layer programmed in standard C (sometimes using cython\cite{cython}.
FabIO makes use of the numerical python module numpy\cite{numpy} and there are
two optional python modules which can be used Lxml, for reading XML files
used in EDNA\cite{edna} and Python Image Library, PIL\cite{pil}.
The PIL representation is useful for displaying images in a GUI based on
the Python Tkinter library\cite{tkinter} and also for access
to the many image processing operations in that library.
Images can displayed in a convenient interactive manner using
matplotlib\cite{matplotlib} and an ipython shell \cite{ipython}, which is
very useful for developing algorithms.
Reading and writing of the various TIFF \cite{tiff} formats is based on the
TiFFIO code of V. Armando Sol\'e from PyMCA \cite{pymca}.
In the Python shell the {\em fabio} module must be imported prior to reading an
image of one of the supported formats (see Table \ref{format}).
The {\em fabio.open} function creates an instance of the python class {\em fabioimage},
from the name of a file.
This instance stores the image data in {\em img.data} as a numpy array
Often the image file contains furthermore information than just
the intensities of the pixels, e.g. information about how the image is
stored and the instrument parameters at the time of the image acquisition.
Header information, if available, is available in {\em img.header} as a Python
dictionary.

Currently, FabIO does not attempt to interpret or translate metadata which
is found in the headers of various frame formats, but merely presents the
information as a string. Neverthless FabIO is capable of converting one
dataformat into another, taking care of the dataformat; for example float array
are converted to integer array if the output format only accepts integers.


\subsection{FabIO methods}

One the strengths of the implementation in an object oriented language as Python
is the possibility to combine functions (or methods) together with data which
are appropriate for specific formats.
In addition to the header information and image data, every fabioimage instance
(returned by fabio.open) provides methods which provide information about the image minimum, maximum and mean values.
There are methods which gives the file number, name etc. One of the most important methods which  actually changes for certain formats
is get next image in a sequence; these functions are next, previous, and
getframe.


\section{Installation}

As any Python module, FabIO can be installed from its sources available on sourceforge\cite{fabio}
but we advice to use the package installer provided for the most common
platforms: Windows, MacOSX and Linux. Moreover FabIO is part of common linux
distribution Ubuntu (since 11.10) and Debian7.

\subsection{Examples}

Opening an image:

\begin{verbatim}
import fabio     
im0 = fabio.open('Quartz_0100.tif') # Open image file
print(im0.data[1024,1024]) # check a pixel value
im1 = im0.next() # Open next image
im270 = im1.getframe(270) # Jump to file number
\end{verbatim}

Normalising the intensity to a value in the header

\begin{verbatim}
img = fabio.open('exampleimage0001.edf')
print img.header
{'ByteOrder': 'LowByteFirst',
 'DATE (scan begin)': 'Mon Jun 28 21:22:16 2010',
 'ESRFCurrent': '198.099',
...
}
# Normalise to beam current and save data
srcur = float(img.header['ESRFCurrent'])
img.data *= 200.0/srcur
img.write('normed_0001.edf')
\end{verbatim}

Interactive viewing

\begin{verbatim}
import pylab								# import pylab from matplotlib
pylab.imshow(img.data)					# display as an image
pylab.show()								# show window
\end{verbatim}

%\begin{verbatim}
%> import fabio
%> im = fabio.open(’Quartz_0100.tif’)	# Open image file
%> im.data								# Print image data
%> im = im.next()						# Open next image
%> im = im.getframe(270)				# Jump to file number.
%\end{verbatim}


%\begin{verbatim}
%> import fabio 								# import the fabio module
%> img = fabio.open(‘exampleimage0001.edf’) 	# Create a fabioimage instance from the file
%> img.header 								# prints all headers from the file as a python dict.
%{'ByteOrder': 'LowByteFirst',

%>
%> import pylab								# import pylab from matplotlib
%> pylab.imshow(img.data)					# display as an image
%> pylab.show()								# show window
%\end{verbatim}


\section{Future and perspectives}

Hierachical data format version 5 (HDF5\cite{hdf5}) is a data format which is
getting popular in the field of X-rays data storage. Mainly processed
data are stored in this format today but new detector should provide native
output in HDF5. Then, FabIO will interface those data using the python binding 
to HDF5 (h5py\cite{h5py}) for providing data via the same interface as of today.

Meanwhile FabIO will be upgraded to Python3; this change of version will affect
a lot of the internal code of FabIO as all string handling and file handling
changed between current Python2 and the new Python3. This change is already
ongoing as many part of native code in C was re-implemented in
Cython\cite{cython} to smoothen the transition as Cython is compatible with
Python3.

\subsection{Conclusion}

FabIO gives an easy way to read and write 2D images when using the
python computer language.
It has originally developed for X-ray diffraction but now gives
an easy way for scientists to access and manipulate
their data from a wide range of range of 2D detectors.
We welcome contributions to fruther improve the code and hope to add
further file formats in the future as well as port the existing code base to the emerging python3.
